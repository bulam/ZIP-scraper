# ZIP code demographics scraper
A python script that scrapes ZIP code demographics attributes from the map on the ESRI ZIP Tapestry website (http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/ziptapestry) using the selenium module and writes the scraped results into an Excel spreadsheet. 

# System setup
It is necessary to have Firefox installed to run the script.

# ToDo
-The scraper sometimes stops after about every 500th scrape. Debug this.
-Add functionality to scrape additional attributes
