A python script that scrapes ZIP code demographics attributes from the map on the ESRI ZIP Tapestry website (http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data/ziptapestry) using the selenium module and writes the scraped results into an Excel spreadsheet. Because the script is written to be used with the Firefox browser, it is necessary to have Firefox installed to run the script.
